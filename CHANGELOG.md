# Changelog

What changed for someone running the server, newest first. **Upgrading** says what to check
before moving to a release; a release with nothing under it upgrades by swapping the version. The
full list of merged changes is on each [GitHub release](https://github.com/tyrunasj/ivanti-mcp-standalone/releases).

## 0.3.5 — 2026-10-25

**Upgrading.** Nothing to check; swap the version. No setting, tool name or required argument changed.

- **`get_service_request_parameters` can evaluate a form.** Pass `subscriptionId` and `answers` and it
  returns `evaluation`: what is shown, hidden, required and still missing, which answers to drop,
  the defaults to send, and the exact `constraints` for each filtered list. Ivanti's portal does
  this in the browser and no call exists for anyone else; this reads the same parsed rules. It
  informs and never refuses, and rules it cannot read are named in `cannotTell`. Not covered:
  auto-fill fields, date-rule checks, and `BeginningOfWeek`.
- **Each parameter says what it depends on.** `filteredBy` (its options depend on those answers),
  `conditionedOn` (whether it is shown or required depends on them) and `valueRule` (a date's lower
  bound, which Ivanti keeps only in `ConfigOptions`).
- **A filtered list is complete for its parent only.** Option answers now say so, so a person missing
  from a list prompts a question instead of a retry loop. `ivanti://reference/picklists` covers
  both kinds of dependency.
- **Dependencies are current, and `pnpm audit --prod` is clean.** The MCP SDK moves to 1.32.1, `zod`
  to 4.6.7 and `fast-xml-parser` to 5.11.2. The lockfile also takes patched versions of four
  transitive packages that carried advisories — `body-parser` (denial of service, high), `hono`,
  `fast-uri` and `ip-address` — and the container's `node:22-slim` base image is refreshed. Build
  and release tooling (vitest, eslint, typescript-eslint, and the upload-artifact, metadata-action
  and action-gh-release GitHub Actions) is updated too; none of it changes runtime behaviour.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-10-11

**Upgrading.** A full code review ([`docs/review/2026-10-11-full-review.md`](docs/review/2026-10-11-full-review.md))
is fixed in this release. Several settings an axis never reads are now refused at start-up instead
of ignored, so check these before moving:

- `BEARER_TOKEN` (or `_FILE`) outside `AUTH_MODE=bearer`, and any `OAUTH_*` outside `oauth`;
- `IVANTI_MAX_TIER` with no tenant, and `IVANTI_IMPERSONATION_ROLE` without the ConfigDB pair;
- a refused API key at start-up now exits 78 (it was 1), and a `$metadata` outage at start-up
  reports itself as one.

The Helm chart gains `server.identityIdleTtlSeconds` and `oauth.requireTyp`; `oauth.audience` takes
a string or a list. It now refuses values that rendered a pod which then exited 78 (for example
`ivanti.impersonationRequired` without `configUrl`).

- **Subtypes get their forms.** One object-id conversion replaces two that disagreed, so
  validated fields, pick lists, link fields and quick-action forms work for `Task#Assignment`,
  `CI#Computer` and every other subtype.
- **Writes say what they know.** A read-back that fails after an accepted write answers "the write
  was accepted; read the record, do not repeat it", never "nothing was changed". An enduser create
  reports `filedFor` only when the stored link confirms it. `link_records` and `unlink_records`
  read the related rows back; `run_quick_action` refuses answers that match no prompt and reports
  the fields that changed. A garbled base64 argument is refused instead of uploading a truncated file.
- **Reads say what they know.** A `$metadata` outage is "could not be read, try again", not
  "no such object", and is not remembered. A failed customer-link sample is not remembered. One
  pre-flight filter check, one compact default and one empty-result caveat serve every read tool.
- **OAuth.** An ID token no longer verifies as an access token; `OAUTH_REQUIRE_TYP=true` also
  demands `typ: at+jwt`. The 401 challenge keeps the metadata URL and scope list whole.
- **HTTP limits.** An initialize body over 64 KiB gets 413; the bodies buffered at once are
  capped, answering 503 with `Retry-After` beyond it; quadratic regexes on filter text are linear.
- **Configurator and handbook.** The settings reference lists every setting the server reads
  (`MCP_PUBLISH_ADDR`, `METRICS_PUBLISH_ADDR`, `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` and `OAUTH_REQUIRE_TYP`
  were missing), the configurator takes each port from one place and writes every optional
  setting as a commented line with its default, and `pnpm handbook:check` fails when either drifts
  from the schema.
- **Internals.** `register-tools.ts` is split by reason to change, `runTool` maps failures through
  one table, `ivanti/` no longer imports upward, dead exports are gone, and the dev-only
  `source-map-js` advisory is overridden.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-10-09

**Upgrading.** `MCP_PORT` no longer defaults to 3000, nor `METRICS_PORT` to 9464. A deployment
with HTTP on and no `MCP_PORT`, or with `METRICS_ON=true` and no `METRICS_PORT`, now refuses to
start (exit 78) and names the setting. Set it to the port you were using. The Helm chart always
sets both, so a chart deployment needs nothing.

- **MCP SDK 1.31.0**, from 1.30.0, for CVE-2026-104850 (high). The protocol version is
  unchanged, `2025-11-25`, so clients see no difference.
- **No built-in ports.** Every port comes from configuration: the server, the container health
  check and `docker/compose.yaml`, which now reads `MCP_PORT` from the same `.env` as the container
  (`docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/compose.yaml up`) and refuses to start without it.
  A default port had to be repeated by hand in `MCP_PUBLIC_URL`, the client and the published
  ports, and changing one copy left the server answering where nothing was looking.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-10-05

**Upgrading.** Nothing needs setting, but three things behave differently:

- the Helm chart's readiness probe is now `/ready`, so a pod whose tenant stops answering leaves
  rotation instead of taking traffic it cannot serve;
- filters Ivanti misreads are refused with how to rewrite them — anything that sent a group after
  the start, an `and` after an `or`, or `not` got wrong rows before and gets an error now;
- requests to the tenant are capped at 16 in flight and tool calls at 120 a minute per
  conversation; raise `IVANTI_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` or `MCP_MAX_CALLS_PER_MINUTE` if a busy
  deployment hits them (the `ivanti request cap reached` and `tool call rate limited` warnings).

- **Runtime base rebuilt:** `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22-debian13` now carries `libssl3t64`
  `3.5.7-1~deb13u3`, for CVE-2026-75804 and CVE-2026-84782. A scan of the image finds nothing
  critical or high.
- **`/ready`**, beside `/health`: 503 once the tenant has failed two checks in a row, a minute
  apart, and 200 again on the first that passes. The Helm chart's readiness probe uses it; startup
  and liveness stay on `/health`, so a tenant outage takes a pod out of rotation without
  restarting it. Point a load balancer's health check at it.
- **A 401 on the service account's own calls no longer re-opens the person's Ivanti session.**
  Only a 401 on the person's session does; before, a refused key threw away a session that was
  fine.
- **Every image is scanned before it is published** — the release refuses one with a critical or
  high finding that has a fix — and the published `latest` is scanned every week.
- **`IVANTI_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`** (default 16): a cap on requests in flight to the tenant at
  once. Past it a request waits its turn, and one that waits out its timeout fails as never sent.
- **`MCP_MAX_CALLS_PER_MINUTE`** (default 120): tool calls per conversation per minute; past it a
  call is refused with how long to wait. Both are new defaults rather than new requirements —
  nothing needs setting on upgrade.
- **Three known limits closed:** two initializes from one person at the same instant no longer
  leave them above `MCP_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_SUBJECT`; shutdown waits for the release a client's own
  DELETE started; with stdio beside an `oauth` HTTP transport, the stdio conversation is told to
  ask who it is helping rather than that its sign-in already says.
- **`group_count` with a filter counted wrong.** Ivanti honours parentheses only at the start of a
  `$filter`, and each bucket put the caller's filter last — so buckets could add up to many times
  the total. The same cause made `act_as` miss on a person's full name at the exact lookup. Both
  now put the group first.
- **Filters Ivanti would misread are refused before sending**, with how to rewrite them: a group
  anywhere but the start, an `and` after an `or` in the same group, and `not`. Ivanti answers each
  with a 200 and the wrong rows — `not` with every row.
- **Prometheus metrics, off by default.** `METRICS_ON=true` serves `GET /metrics` on a port of its
  own (`METRICS_PORT`, 9464), never the MCP port, bound to `METRICS_BIND` (`127.0.0.1`), with an
  optional scrape-only `METRICS_TOKEN` / `_FILE`. Tool calls by tool and outcome, Ivanti requests by
  method and status, latencies, sessions, evictions and refusals, readiness, memory — never a
  person, filter, record or ticket text. A browser's request is refused (403). Startup refuses a
  metrics port equal to `MCP_PORT`, a token under 32 characters, and a token equal to another
  secret, only while metrics are on. The chart gains `metrics.*`: a Service of its own the Ingress
  never routes to, an optional ServiceMonitor, and a NetworkPolicy rule. Nothing changes on upgrade
  unless you turn it on; leave it off on an internet-facing deployment unless something private
  scrapes it.
- `create_record` in `enduser` no longer credits Ivanti's session with the `CreatedBy` the server
  stamped itself. The third-party notices now include nested dependencies.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-09-30

A security patch.

- **Runtime base: `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs22-debian13`.** The Debian 12 image had stopped being
  rebuilt, so it still carried OpenSSL and glibc that Debian had fixed. Node 22.22.0 → 22.23.3.
- **`proxy-addr` 2.0.8, `fast-uri` 3.1.8, `ip-address` 10.7.2**, for CVE-2026-90711,
  GHSA-hrr3-gc8f-f4qj, CVE-2026-101911 and CVE-2026-101912.
- A scan of the image finds nothing critical, and nothing high that has a fix.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-30

The 50 fixes from the full review of 2026-09-29, and Windows as a fourth way to run it.

**Upgrading.** The server now refuses settings 0.2.x accepted, and exits `78` naming them:

- any `ENDUSER_*` setting with `MCP_MODE=full` (or `MCP_MODE` unset) — remove it, or set
  `MCP_MODE=enduser` if that was the intent;
- a bearer token under 32 characters — `openssl rand -hex 32` makes one;
- a plain `http://` for `IVANTI_BASE_URL`, `IVANTI_CONFIG_URL`, `OAUTH_ISSUER` or
  `OAUTH_JWKS_URI` anywhere but loopback;
- under `oauth`, an `email` claim names the person only with `email_verified: true` — a provider
  that leaves the flag out needs `OAUTH_IDENTITY_CLAIM` (`preferred_username`, say);
- the Helm chart refuses `replicaCount` above 1, `sessionAffinity`, and `authMode: none` behind a
  `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`.

Also: `IVANTI_TIMEOUT_MS` and `IVANTI_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`; `MCP_MAX_SESSIONS_PER_SUBJECT`;
`IVANTI_IMPERSONATION_REQUIRED`; idle sessions are closed at the session cap rather than new ones
refused; a write that got no answer says it may have been applied; the chart ships a
NetworkPolicy and a `rolloutToken`.
