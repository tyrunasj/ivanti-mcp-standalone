# Ivanti MCP

A standalone [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for **Ivanti Neurons for ITSM** — reading
records, filing tickets, running the tenant's own quick actions, handling approvals — over stdio, or
over HTTP with no authentication, a bearer token or OAuth. **41 tools in `full` mode, 34 in
`enduser`**, plus six reference documents served as MCP resources. Ships as a container image, a
Helm chart and a tarball, all built from one commit.

The server signs in to Ivanti as **one API user**. `act_as` is how a conversation says who it is
helping, and every other tool refuses until it has. Given a ConfigDB key, `act_as` opens a real
Ivanti session *as* that person, so Ivanti applies their own access.

**Running a published build?** Start with the
**[Handbook](https://tyrunasj.github.io/ivanti-mcp-standalone/)** — every setting, every tool, and
a configurator that writes the `.env`, `docker run`, compose file, Helm values and systemd unit.
Its source is [`docs/handbook.html`](docs/handbook.html); the `Pages` workflow publishes it from
`main`.

## Development

Node 22 or later and pnpm (the version is pinned in `package.json`). `helm` is needed only for the
chart check, Docker only for the image.

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env      # set IVANTI_BASE_URL and IVANTI_API_KEY
pnpm dev                  # tsx watch; or pnpm build && pnpm start
```

The server **fails closed**: an incomplete or contradictory configuration exits `78` and lists
every problem at once. `.env.example` documents every setting; [`examples/env/`](examples/env)
holds working configurations to start from.

**Before a PR:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build` — all four. Changed a tool
description, an argument or the server `instructions`? Run `pnpm handbook:sync` too. CI runs more
checks than these; [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md) lists them and says when to run
each locally.

**`main` is protected**, admins included: every change goes through a PR with `Checks` and `Image`
green. A change to the tool surface is verified by driving it against the live tenant, not only by
tests — the loop is in [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md#testing-against-the-live-tenant).

**Read first, depending on the change:**

- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — the source layout, the invariants and the budgets, in one page.
- [`docs/initial-design.md`](docs/initial-design.md) — before any architectural change; §10 lists
  the alternatives already rejected, and why.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) — how each part works, and why.
- [`docs/notes.md`](docs/notes.md) — when Ivanti behaves unexpectedly. Add to it when you hit a
  trap.
