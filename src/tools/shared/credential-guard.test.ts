 * Three ways a file can end up on the service account, not one.

 * The guard used to match only the literal property access, with a lookahead that exempted a
 * trailing comma. Two live tools walked past it for a whole release:
 *
 * - `const { transport } = deps.connection;` — destructuring never writes `deps.connection.`
 *   at all, and in `list_assigned_work` it happened at FACTORY scope, where `transportFor` could
 *   not have applied even if someone had wanted it to.
 * - `resolveValidatedWrite({ connection: deps.connection, … })` — handing the whole connection to
 *   a helper that then reaches for `.forms`, `.session` and `.transport` itself.
 *
 * So the whole-connection forms are matched too. What is deliberately NOT matched is a member that
 * is a tenant fact rather than a person's data — `metadata`, `people`, `capability`,
 * `serviceRequests`, `admin` — which nine files read legitimately and which `connectionFor` keeps
 * on the service account by design. Matching those would need a nine-entry exemption list and
 * would cost the guard its signal.
