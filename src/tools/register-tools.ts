 * what makes identity a per-conversation fact rather than a global.
 *
 * Every call is audited here, and gated here, because this is the one place they all pass
 * through. Argument values are never logged — they carry ticket text and personal data — so the
 * record is what was called, by which session, on whose behalf, and how that was established; a

/**
 * How a conversation ends, and why a stdio process has to be told.
 *
 * Over HTTP a conversation *is* a session: the store sweeps it once it goes quiet and the whole
 * server — pin included — is thrown away with it. A stdio process has no such thing. It is one
 * connection for the life of the process, so a client that keeps the server running across
 * conversations, which is the ordinary shape, carried the first person's pin into every
 * conversation that followed: the person outlived the conversation that named them.
 *
 * Two signals end one, and neither is within the model's reach — a tool that could end a
 * conversation could shed the pin, which is the one thing the pin exists to prevent:
 *
 * - **Silence.** No tool call for `idleMs` — `MCP_IDENTITY_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS`. Its own setting,
 *   not the session sweep's: how long a person's records stay reachable to whoever is at the
 *   keyboard is not the same question as how long a dead HTTP session may hold memory.
 * - **A fresh `initialize`.** The client saying so itself, which is exact but arrives only from
 *   clients that re-initialize rather than reconnect. Silence is the one that always arrives.
