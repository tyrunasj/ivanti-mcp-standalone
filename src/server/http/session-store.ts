/**
 * Bounded, idle-expiring map of live MCP sessions.
 *
 * Both limits matter. The TTL exists because `onsessionclosed` fires only on an explicit DELETE
 * and clients frequently vanish without sending one. The cap exists because in `none` mode
 * anything that can reach the port can `initialize` indefinitely, which is a denial-of-service
 * surface rather than merely a leak.
 *
 * The cap counts **reserved** slots as well as registered sessions. A session is only registered
 * once its `initialize` has run, so a cap that counted registrations alone admitted every one of
 * a burst of concurrent initializes and then turned the late ones away mid-handshake — as a 404
 * "Session not found", which reads as a server bug rather than as being full.
